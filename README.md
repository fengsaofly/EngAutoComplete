## Overview

This plugin provides several features that simplify working with LaTeX files:

- **Pop-up window** with relevant English examples show up when your mouse hover on a word in tex file, you can select one to navigate to the source
- **Quickpanel** show up by pressing ctrl+alt+shift+s (windows) or super+alt+shift+s (Mac) , you can input keywords to filter and navigate to the source
- **AutoComplete** from all active documents which is offered by AllAutoComplete

## Requirements and Setup

We only offer a hands-on approach, you can always clone the git repository, or else just grab this plugin's .zip file from GitHub and extract it to your Packages directory (you can open it easily from ST, by clicking on **Preferences > Browse Packages**). Then, (re)launch ST. Please note that if you do a manual installation, the Package **must** be named **EngAutoComplete**.

Before you start to work, you should open your English Libraries  (be active in ST3) and make sure every example is splitted by empty line. **Markdown** is only supported by default, which is configurable by Package Settings.

Finally, you'll need to have a working TeX installation and a PDF viewer. For detailed instructions on how to set these up, please email me(xyf_uestc@163.com).
